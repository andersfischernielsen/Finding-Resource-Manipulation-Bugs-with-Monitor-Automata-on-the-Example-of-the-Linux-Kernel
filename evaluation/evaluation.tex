\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make an argument for monitors being better than CTL 
    \item Extensibility
    \setlength\itemindent{15pt} 
    \item Implementation of CTL limits expressiveness, monitor automata are not
    \item Show an automaton that expressed things that CTL cannot
    \item Argue that specifying double-unlock automata on specific bug cases is not an issue, since it again shows the expressiveness 
    \setlength\itemindent{0pt}
    
    \item Measure before (CTL) and after (automata) results
    \item Possible comparison to BLAST and Cocinelle tools
\end{itemize}

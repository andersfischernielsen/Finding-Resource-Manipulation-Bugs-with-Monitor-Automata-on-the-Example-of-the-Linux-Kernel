\subsection*{Abstract}

Monitor templates define define properties of source code leading to ressource manipulation bugs on memory cells, allowing detecting and reporting these bugs. I define monitor templates and their implementation on the example of the Linux kernel by extending the \textit{shape-and-effect} analysis by Iago Abal et. al.
Monitor templates are deterministic finite automata specified on so-called \textit{effects} found of executing program point in the control flow of a program.

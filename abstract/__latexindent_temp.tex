\subsection*{Abstract}

I present a way of expressing bug checkers operating on the example of the Linux kernel as state machines as so-called \textit{monitor templates}. Monitor templates define define properties of source code leading to ressource manipulation bugs on memory cells, allowing detecting and reporting these bugs. I define monitor templates and their implementation on the example of the Linux kernel by extending the \textit{shape-and-effect} analysis by Iago Abal et. al. \cite{Abal2017EffectiveBF}. Monitor templates are deterministic finite automata specified on so-called \textit{effects} inferred from executing program points in the control flow of a program. I present an implemented reference implementation of such monitor templates as an extension to the work by Abal et. al. and an evaluation of the resulting bug checker on the Linux kernel showing a higher precision for detection of bugs compared to a previous approach based on the existing theory by Abal. et. al.\cite{research-project}, albeit with a greater number of false positives being present as well.

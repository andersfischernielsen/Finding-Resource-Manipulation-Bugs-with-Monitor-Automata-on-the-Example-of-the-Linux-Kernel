\subsection{Control Flow}

EBA provides a representation of the control flow of the input source files which is utilized in order to detect bugs. EBA generates a tree structure of the input, modeling statements as so-called \texttt{step}s. A path in this tree structure models a possible execution path, with each \texttt{step} in a path containing information about the modelled statements. The concrete tree structure modeling the resulting effects of statements can be formalized as a finite state machine $(\sum, S, s_0, \delta, F)$ as follows where $\sum$ is the input alphabet, $S$ is a finite non-empty set of states, $s_0$ is an element of $S$ and initial state, $\delta$ is the state-transition function $\delta: S \times \sum \rightarrow S$ and $F$ is the possibly empty set of final states and a subset of $S$. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item{
        $
            \begin{aligned}[t] 
                \sum = & \{\mathit{Seq}, \mathit{If\_true}(s), \mathit{If\_false}(s), Nil, (alloc, \rho), (free, \rho), (read, \rho), \\ & (write , \rho), (uninit, \rho), (call, \rho), (lock, \rho), (unlock, \rho)\}
            \end{aligned} 
        $
    }
    \item{
        $
            \begin{aligned}[t]
                S = & \{(allocated, \rho), If_true, If_false, (freed, \rho), (read, \rho), (written , \rho),\\ & (uninitialized, \rho), (called, \rho), (locked, \rho), (unlocked, \rho), End\}
            \end{aligned}
        $
    }
\end{itemize}

\noindent The initial state, $s_0$, is dependent on the control flow being modelled, and can therefore be any element of $\sum$. The same applies for the transition function $\delta$ and the set of final states $F$, which is also a subset of $\sum$. A concrete definition for an example control flow with an illustration of this in figure \ref{cfg_example-automaton} is shown below.

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $s_0 = Seq$ 
    \item {
        $
            \begin{aligned}[t]
            \delta = \mathit{the \; relation} \{ & (Seq, (\texttt{alloc},\rho), (allocated, \rho)), ((allocated, \rho), (\texttt{write}, \rho), (written, \rho)), \\
            & ((written, \rho), If\_true(s), If\_true), ((written, \rho), If\_false(s), \\ & If\_false), (If\_true, Nil, End), (If\_false, Nil, End)\}
            \end{aligned}
        $ 
    }
    \item $F = Nil$  
\end{itemize}

\noindent A few things are of note here; $Nil$ indicates the end of a path in the tree structure. $\mathit{If}$ indicates a branch in the input source file and models possible branches in if-statements.

\subsection{Monitor Templates}
A monitor template is defined as the quintuple $X_\rho (\sum, S, s_0, \delta, F)$ where $\sum$ is the input alphabet, $S$ is a finite non-empty set of states happening on the region $\rho$, $s_0$ is an element of $S$ and initial state, $\delta$ is the state-transition function $\delta: S \times \sum \rightarrow S$ and $F$ is the possibly empty set of final states and a subset of $S$.

\newpar Monitor automata operate on the set of possible effects of a statement in the Control-flow Graph, which are defined as $E = \{$\texttt{alloc}, \texttt{free}, \texttt{read}, \texttt{write}, \texttt{uninit}, \texttt{call}, \texttt{lock}, \texttt{unlock}$\}$ by Abal \cite{EffectiveBugFinding}, corresponding all possible variants of the $mem\_kind$ type defined previously. 

\newpar Monitor automata in this thesis all operate on a subset of $E$ and have a non-empty set of final states, $F$, indicating that a possible bug is discovered.  

\subsubsection{Double-unlock monitor automata}

Given a region $\rho$, a double-unlock monitor automata is defined as the quintuple $(\sum, S, s_0, \delta, F)$ where: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sum = \{\texttt{unlock}_\rho, \texttt{lock}_\rho\}$, a subset of $E$
    \item $S = \{ locked_\rho, unlocked_\rho, error_\rho \}$
    \item $s_0 = unlocked_\rho$ 
    \item $\delta =$ the relation $\{(locked_\rho, \texttt{unlock}_\rho, unlocked_\rho), (locked_\rho, \texttt{lock}_\rho, locked_\rho), \\
        (unlocked_\rho, \texttt{lock}_\rho, locked_\rho), (unlocked_\rho, \texttt{unlock}_\rho, error_\rho)\}$ 
    \item $F = error_\rho$
